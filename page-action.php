			<h4>STREET COURSE AT KIC</h4>
			<p>For the very first time, the street course competition will be moved from inside Jiangwan Stadium to out on the streets (literally); as the organisers aim to keep the action authentic within a natural yet competitive setting.</p>
			<p>Pioneering the build and design of a new street course at Shanghai’s KIC Plaza (which is used by urban skaters), organisers will integrate proven formats from other street course global competitions but use an existing structure at KIC Plaza and enhance the course with new elements and features.</p>
